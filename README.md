# Re:lax

**_because you forgot to stop ~_**

We built **Re:lax** because the "one more minute" lie is the enemy of your well-being. When the screen fades, it’s not a lockout—it’s a sanctuary.

### The Core Intent

- **The Intentional Pause:** At set intervals, a soft, translucent shield envelops your workspace. It’s non-negotiable, and that is its beauty.
- **Permission to Let Go:** By removing the "Skip" button, **Re:lax** makes the choice for you. No guilt, no negotiation, just rest.
- **Human-First:** We prioritize your spine, your eyes, and your mind over your uptime.

### How it Works

> Focus is a gift. Don’t burn it out.

1. **Work:** Deep and focused.
2. **Fade:** The screen becomes a quiet, frosted space.
3. **Breathe:** For a few minutes, the digital world doesn't exist.
4. **Return:** Clearer, sharper, and more human.
